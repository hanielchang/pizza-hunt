// ---------------------------------Notes--------------------------------- //

// As part of the browser's window object, indexedDB is a global variable. 
// Thus, we could say window.indexedDB, but there's no need to.

// We create the request variable (line 5) to act as an event listener for the database. That event listener 
// is created when we open the connection to the database using the indexedDB.open() method.

// In IndexedDB, the container that stores the data is called an object store. 
// We can't create an object store until the connection to the database is open, 
// emitting an event that the request variable will be able to capture.

// IndexedDB infers that a change needs to be made when the database is 
// first connected (which we're doing now) or if the version number changes.

// Thus, this onupgradeneeded event will emit the first time we run this code and 
// create the new_pizza object store. The event won't run again unless we delete the 
// database from the browser or we change the version number in the .open() method 
// to a value of 2, indicating that our database needs an update.

// When this event executes, we store a locally scoped connection to the database 
// and use the .createObjectStore() method to create the object store that will hold 
// the pizza data. With IndexedDB, we have a veritable blank slateâ€”we'll 
// have to establish all of the rules for working with the database.

// For that reason, when we create the new_pizza object store, we also instruct 
// that store to have an auto incrementing index for each new set of data we insert. 
// Otherwise we'd have a hard time retrieving data.

// --------- Regarding transactions ----------
// With IndexedDB, we don't always have that direct connection like we do with SQL and 
// MongoDB databases, so methods for performing CRUD operations with IndexedDB aren't 
// available at all times. Instead, we have to explicitly open a transaction, or a temporary 
// connection to the database. This will help the IndexedDB database maintain an accurate 
// reading of the data it stores so that data isn't in flux all the time.

// ----------- Function UploadPizza() -----------
// Now, you may think that the getAll variable will automatically receive the data from 
// the new_pizza object store, but unfortunately it does not. Because the object stores 
// can be used for both small and large file storage, the .getAll() method is an asynchronous 
// function that we have to attach an event handler to in order to retrieve the data. Let's add that next.

// If there's data to send, we send that array of data we just retrieved to the server at 
// the POST /api/pizzas endpoint. Fortunately, the Mongoose .create() method we use to create 
// a pizza can handle either single objects or an array of objects, so no need to create another
// route and controller method to handle this one event.
